# High Volume Data Embedding in Image Steganography

The project is developed to accomplish high volume data embedding in image steganography using high performance computing. 

## Description

High Performance computing is used to achieve both processes in Image Steganography - Embedding and Extraction. Separate modules have been written in QT C++ to achieve the project objective. 

OpenMP has been used for parallel computing.
DG image library has been used for image manipulation.

### Setting up the Project

The project is developed using QT C++. 
1. Install QT Creator
2. Import the project
3. Run the project, and select appropriate files for input (Image and Text files)
